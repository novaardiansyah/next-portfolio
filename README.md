# Nova Personal Portfolio

Hi Future Developer, 

Welcome to my latest project! This time, I’m excited to share my personal portfolio project, which I originally built back in June 2024. However, I initially kept it private because it included an admin functionality. Back then, I built the portfolio using Laravel 10 and Filament 3. While both technologies are relatively new and perform well, I realized that separating the frontend and backend would be a more optimal approach.

For this reason, in this project, I decided to migrate all frontend functionalities from Laravel to Next.js while keeping Laravel as the backend. This project is open source, and I’ll be sharing all the source code in this repository so that it can serve as a reference for anyone interested in learning from it.

However, please note that I do not provide an API or CMS backend for this project. If you plan to use it, you’ll need to create your own API/CMS backend. Additionally, I do not offer support for installation, so you’ll need to learn how to set it up on your own.
